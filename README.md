# ElvUI-ProjectZidras for WOTLK (3.3.5a)
Plugin for ElvUI that aims to add and improve features of the addon. Here is a list of the most relevant changes:
1. Nameplates castbars: this will only work with HD client (http://forum.warmane.com/showthread.php?t=437071&p=3116959#post3116959). Client's default nameplates castbars appear on all the casting nameplates, and this plugin converts them to ElvUI standards.
  
## How to install and update the addon
1. Download the addon from the **main** repository (https://github.com/Zidras/ElvUI_ProjectZidras/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Inside the zip file, open ElvUI_ProjectZidras-main and copy (Ctrl+C) the folder over to your addons folder (Interface/Addons). 
3. (**Advisable**) On your addons folder (Interface/Addons), before pasting, delete ElvUI_ProjectZidras (you will not lose your profiles doing this, don't worry - those are on WTF folder). This ensures that there is no remnant file that could potentially conflict with the latest version of the plugin.
4. On your addons folder (Interface/Addons), paste (Ctrl+V) the previously copied folder here. DO NOT put the ElvUI_ProjectZidras-main folder directly into the addon folder, it will not work.
